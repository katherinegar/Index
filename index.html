<h2 class="major">Reading One: Touring 
<br> Complete Users</h2>
								
<p><b>1. What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"?</b></p> 
<p>I believe Lialina sees the word “User” as a general term to those who use computer software. Anyone who uses these applications can be seen as a user. Such as bloggers, artists, podcasters, etc. However, she hesitates on generalizing it so much. As the world of technology brodens, so does the diverse audience it welcomes. It becomes difficult to group these people under one label while the distinction between the groups is so important.</p>
<p><b>2. What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</b></p>
<p>Lialina separates her idea of what “a real user” is compared to those who aren’t by first characterizing them as people who pay for their system. She also describes the user as someone who existed prior to computers; the imagination and brains behind the screen. She speaks on the idea that the core of being a “user” is understanding the scripts, links and the web itself. These people engage with the internet as a tool that is not necessary. Because computers are becoming nearly invisible, the other users don’t understand the very roots that it was built on. </p>
<p><b>3. From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users".</b></p>
<p>To me, because computers have become so much smaller, people believe that because they have the newest technology or live a life through their devices, they are immediately deemed a “user”. The difficulty in this is that, when it comes to influencers or people who have created a digital lifestyle, they don’t begin to understand the importance of how it all works. They take the easy way and fail to use the proper software. This can create errors in which they won’t know how to fix.</p>

<h2 class="major">Reading 2: The Poetry of Tools </h2>
<p><b>1. In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</b></p>
<p>When Seu mentions ‘defamiliarize our tools’ I believe she is speaking on the fact we only see our tools as tools, nothing more. We've become so accustomed to this routine of using these things, we do it without looking into what they can really do. The way they affect us, our gestures that go into using them. We need to gather a new perspective when we choose to interact with technology. She uses the quote from David Jhave Johnston which explains what poetry is. Poetry isn’t just words written on paper, it can take on many different forms. It’s a form of living and through it, we can find new limits. The constraints of technology makes it difficult for many of us to go against the grain, however, it is possible to go beyond. By losing these restrictions, there can be endless possibilities. We can use these tools to create the content we want to see.
 </p>
 <p><b> 2. Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</b></p>					
 <p>Regeneration is a tool used on older work in order to push new boundaries. The intention behind this tool is to create a more appealing unit that demonstrates the uses of new technology while still using the structure from the original work. A great example of this comes from http://www.dgf5.com/ (Links to an external site.). The site which is a standard layout of links directing to various websites, continues to shift to different fonts as the mouse moves around the page. The fonts used were also all typical from an older website (times new, arial, courier new etc).  The simple ability to shift between fonts, shows the modern technology of hover ability. This would not have been possible years before and with this, gives a more entertaining experience to the user.</p>

<h2 class="major">Reading 3:</h2>
<p><b>1. Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</b></p>
<p>Laurel speaks of the issue that resonates within social media and the companies that controls it. This being the idea that profit is more important than the users. She goes on to explain that individual websites are more of an expression. It’s your own identity, something that social media used to be. We see that sites like YouTube and Instagram prioritize themselves over the creativity that the users have as well as the experience the channels bring. Facebook is a prime example of this as we see Mark Zuckerberg now being held in court for exploiting users data and refusing to remove false political advertisements. It is no longer about the experience the channels have with the users. I agree with Laurel to the fullest extent. Creativity is now put on the back burner with these large companies. As technology advances, and social media begins to pull in more users, the issue only grows. What started as a means to express oneselves, has quickly changed to a ‘get rich quick’ scheme.</p>
<p><b>In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here.</b></p>
<p>Schwulst is able to explain the endless possibilities that a website is, through various metaphors. To me, a website is a canvas. It begins as a blank slate waiting to be painted. We add different elements and as we do, a beautiful image of self expression is born. It becomes something we are proud of and want to showcase. Websites are items of art which don’t always get the recognition for their beauty. Schwulst began her article speaking of the loss of identity within social media. Art is all about self expression and building a website is no exception.
